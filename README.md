# MATLAB_PSO_GA

Project contains examples for using MATLABs PSO and GA algorithms for finding MPC matricies.

## Getting Started

  * Clone Project
  * Clone Project MORUS_MATLAB
  * Open MATLAB
  * Position in MATLAB_PSO_GA folder
  * addpath('path_to_MORUS_MATLAB')
  * run one of the algorithams

### Prerequisites

Examples are made in MATLAB 2019a



## Built With

* [MATLAB 2019a](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/)

## Acknowledgments

* Basic example for using MATLAB GA and PSO (for other purposes just change cost function, upper and lower limits, number of optimizied variables )
* Inspiration : finding desire region for MPC control
